# Germplasm Acquisition Case Study

**A single sweet potato germplasm request took 7 months and 36+ emails. AI can fix this.**

## The Problem

A researcher requested sweet potato germplasm from an international genebank. The request didn't match available inventory, and no one knew that upfront — triggering months of back-and-forth across 7 people, 3 email threads, and 6 major scope changes.

## What Happened

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 7 months |
| **Emails** | 36+ |
| **People involved** | 7 |
| **Scope changes** | 6 |

The original request was for 20 in-vitro accessions (white, orange, purple) plus botanical seed in all three colors. Over the following months, white seed turned out not to exist, purple seed wasn't available until the next year, wild species were added then removed, a personnel handoff required re-explaining everything, and at final shipment 4 of 15 seed families were missing.

## What AI Could Fix

An AI system would cross-reference requests against real-time inventory on day one, present only available options, orchestrate multi-party workflows automatically, and guide requesters through the platform — collapsing 7 months into a single session.
